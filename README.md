Step 1: Pick a Tote Bag
Note: There are thicker and thinner tote bags available. The thinner ones are easier to fold and create patterns with, and they take less time to pre-wash and dye. The thicker ones are of better quality but are harder to fold into different shapes and require more time to dye.

Step 2: Choose Your Preferred Patterns
Explore and select your preferred patterns. 

Here are some examples:

Step 3: Pre-wash Your Tote or Fabric

This step helps to remove any finishes that may interfere with dye absorption.

Step 4: Soak Fabrics in the Indigo Dye Bucket

Wear gloves and an apron for protection. The dyeing process may take 3-15 minutes, and you should gently stir the solution to make the dye fully contact with fabrics. Also, observe it during dying to achieve desirable saturations of blue or gradient colors.

Note: The dye is non-toxic, but please avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing.

Saturation: By soaking for different durations, you can achieve various shades of color. Note that the wet fabric will appear slightly lighter than its dry color.

Different color saturation:

Gradient: Partially soaking the fabric can create a gradient effect.

Step 5: Rinse After Achieving Desired Color

Once you are satisfied with the color, remove the fabric from the bucket. Do not unbind the fabric yet. Gently wash the tote or fabric in the sink in running water.

Step 6: Use the Dye Fixative Solution

Soak the fabric in the fixative solution (a transparent solution) for 10 minutes.
Note: The solution may appear bluish due to the dye from the fabric. Please read the labels on the bucket for further instructions.

Step 7: Rinse in Cool Water. After rinsing, remove the bindings (rubber bands, woodblocks, twine, etc.) and enjoy the unique patterns you've created!
